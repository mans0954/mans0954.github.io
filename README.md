# Introduction

I'm a [Mathematician](mathematics.md) with research interests in the structure of JB\*-triples. For the last few years I've been making contributions to [Mathlib](mathlib.md). My day job is as a [Senior DevOps Engineer](DevOps.md). When I'm not at a computer I like to be out [photographing wildlife](NaturalHistory.md).
